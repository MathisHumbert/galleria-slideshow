# Frontend Mentor - Galleria slideshow site

This is a Frontend Mentor Project that I coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.

This project was pretty focus on layout and on CSS. I manage to use JS and the JSON file to display all of the content and use the less HTML as possible.

I struggled with the layout of the table and desktop, i used grid and masonry but this is not available for all web browser so I used display column and columns: number of columns. This is not the best solution.

I had a lot of fun doing this project bcause od the style of this website!
